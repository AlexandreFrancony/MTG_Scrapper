# MTG_Scrapper

This Project contains 3 scrappers in jupyter notebooks.

1) The first scrapper goes to [Cardmarket - Phyrexia : All Will Be One](https://www.cardmarket.com/fr/Magic/Products/Singles/Phyrexia-All-Will-Be-One) and gets informations about all cards in the set.

2) The second scrapper gets a wishlist of some cards, and gets you the first 5 prices, the average price (7 days) and the quantity available.

3) The third scrapper gets a decklist with the languages accepted and the minimal condition of the card you would accept, and it gets you the cards you can buy for the lowest price with your exigences.
